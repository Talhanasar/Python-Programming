# Python Programming Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Python programming lessons designed to teach foundational and advanced programming concepts. Each lesson includes a focused program that demonstrates a specific concept, helping learners grasp Python's capabilities and practical applications. The lessons progress from basic syntax to more complex topics like data structures, modules, and object-oriented programming.

## Contents

### Basic Lessons
- **Lesson 1:** Introduction to Python by printing "Hello World!" and using operators for string repetition.
- **Lesson 2:** Understanding variables and their types (integers, floats, strings, Booleans).
- **Lesson 3:** Using the `input()` function to gather user input and combining strings.
- **Lesson 4:** Creating a temperature converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit).
- **Lesson 5:** Demonstrating string slicing techniques.
- **Lesson 6:** Exploring string concatenation and formatted strings (f-strings).
- **Lesson 7:** Applying various string methods such as `len()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, and `replace()`.

### Intermediate Lessons
- **Lesson 8:** Performing arithmetic operations and understanding Python‚Äôs order of operations.
- **Lesson 9:** Using the `math` module for functions like `abs()`, `ceil()`, and `factorial()`.
- **Lesson 10-12:** Working with conditional statements and logical/comparison operators.
- **Lesson 13-15:** Introducing loops (while, for) and nested loops for matrix-like operations.
- **Lesson 16-19:** Exploring lists, 2D lists, and list methods; identifying unique items in a list.

### Advanced Lessons
- **Lesson 20-21:** Understanding tuples and tuple operations like unpacking.
- **Lesson 22-24:** Exploring dictionaries, emoji conversion using dictionaries, and function creation.
- **Lesson 25-27:** Working with functions, reusable logic, and exception handling.
- **Lesson 28-33:** Covering comments, object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance), and modules.
- **Lesson 35:** Interacting with the file system using the `os` module.
